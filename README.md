## Description

This is a notes app I created with what I've learnt from Colt Steels web developer course. 

## Built with 

Javascript

## What I learnt 

Instead of printing everything to the console I tried using the alert function, but then I realised that I can't display the whole array in one alert box, perhaps there is a way but I think the console will suffice for now.

Colt is a great teacher, he explains everything in a way I can easily(most of the time) understand.
